# Discrete-element-Modeling-of-nacre-like-materials

This code made as a part of Internship done under Dr. Anup S, IIST. The repository includes the Matlab code developed for DEM modelling of Staggered Composites.

The Matlab codes which helped to make the final DEM Modelling code is also included. The other Matlab Codes Include
1) 1D Spring
2) Generalized 2D Truss Members
3) Representative Volume Element (RVE) using Analytic Method 
4) Representative Volume Element (RVE) using Numerical Method
5) Statistical Volume Element (SVE) for Staggered Composite
6) Arc Length Control Method for SVE (currrently working on for improving the results)

The above codes are made from a Reference Paper "Discrete-element modeling of nacre-like materials: Effects of random microstructures on strain localization and mechanical performance", by Najmul Abid, Mohammad Mirkhalaf, Francois Barthelat
